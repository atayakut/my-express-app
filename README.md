Express.js Web Application
Project Overview:
This project is a simple web application built with Express.js that demonstrates fetching and rendering JSON data on a web page. The app serves static HTML pages and provides a backend API to handle requests for JSON data. It uses Node.js for the server-side logic and Express.js as the web framework to handle routing and HTTP requests.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Express.js: A web framework for Node.js to build robust web applications.
JavaScript: For both the frontend and backend scripting.
HTML: Used to create the structure of the web pages.
CSS: For styling the frontend.
JSON: The data format used for the API response.
Features:
Frontend Pages:

The application has several static HTML pages such as index.html, about.html, contact.html, and api.html.
These pages are designed to demonstrate various aspects of the application and fetch data from the backend.
JSON Data Handling:

The server responds to the frontend with JSON data.
The application fetches this JSON data and displays it dynamically in the web browser.
API Endpoint:

The app has an API endpoint (e.g., /api/data) that returns JSON data when accessed. This can be used to simulate a real-world API that sends data to the frontend.
Responsive Design:

The application is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience across various devices.
